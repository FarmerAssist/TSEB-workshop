    "# About the surface temperature\n",
    "We alredy mentioned that the aerodynamic temperature ($T_0$), which is the temperature that holds valid the sensible heat flux equation, is different to the radiometric surface temperature (LST) estimated with Earth Observation remote sensing. It is therefore to be aware of such difference and thus be able to correctly interpret LST when estimating sensible heat flux and/or ET.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Indeed, the different remote sensing ET models mainly differ on how they use the LST in order to retrieve $H$ and/or $\\lambda E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, since heat is exchanged less efficiently than momentum, it is needed to correctly define the aerodynamic roughness length for heat transport ($z_0H$), and inndeed the relationship $z_{0H} \\approx 0.1 z_{0M}$ might not be valid for any type of surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly is the fact that the radiometric surface temperature could significantly change depending on the view observation angle. This is particular relevant for Earth Obsevation sensors with a wide field of view or wide swath, such as Sentinel-3 SLSTR, with view zenith angles from nadir ($VZA = 0$Âº) up to VZAs of 50Âº or 60Âº. The reason of this issue is that the sensor might see a different proportion of (cool) vegetation and (warm) soil. Indeeed, we saw in the previous exercise that the canopy transmittance depends on the canopy density, the leaf angle distribution, and the incidence/illumination angle. This effect is perfectly reciprocal when we deal with de sensor geometry instead of the solar geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive plot below show this effect. You can define the sensor's view zenith angle as well as the dominant leaf inclination angle. According to the soil and canopy temperatures estimated by the [previous task](#ET_simulations), and after setting as well the soil and leaf emissivity, the graph will display the estimated LST for a range of LAIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can modify the simulation parameters [here](#ET_simulations) and the changes will be reflected in the simulated LST.\n",

    "3. The canopy structure, which drives how efficiently the canopy dissipates the heat and vapour towards the atmosphere.\n",

In any case there exists a wide range of other energy balance models that allow esimating ET from remote sensing, all of them with their own strenghts and weakenesses. The final objective of this session is to introduce you the most relevant physical processes regarding ET, with the hope that you could form a critical knowledge allowing you to decide with model to use for your requirements.
