The air is composed of gases and particles that absorb radiation (most of them at certain wavelengths such as the Ozone or the Oxygen).

    "Assuming that a canopy is primarily composed by leaves, and that these leaves intercept and absorbed radiation (mostly photosynthetically active radition, PAR), we could evaluate how much radiation is intercepted by the canopy according to the foliage density. The latter is usually defined as the Leaf Area index: half of the total leaf surface per unit ground. The larger the LAI, the more likely that the sun beams will be intercepted by one or more leaves, and, thus less likely for solar beams to reach the ground. \n",

    "The solar elevation angle ($\\beta$ in the previous graph), or its complementary the solar zenith angle (SZA), also plays a relevant role.

    "Since leaves are solid elements with a finite size (as oppposed to the gases in the atmosphere), their orientation with respect to the nadir also plays a relevant role. Therefore, the Beer-Lambert law must be adapted to account for this effect. In the next graph, you will be able to experience with this phenomenon. Try changing both the amount of leaves in terms of LAI and the dominant zenith orientation of leaves, i.e. from canopies with predominantly vertical (LIDF$\\approx$90º) leaves to predominantly horizontal (LIDF$\\approx$0º) leaves."

    "# The albedo\n",

The shortwave net radiation ($S_n$) is therefore the balance between the incident shortwave irradiance ($S^\\downarrow$) and the reflected shortwave radiance ($S^\\uparrow = \\alpha S^\\downarrow$)\n",

    "The spectral properties of the surface are key in determining the albedo. For instance, fresh snow shows large values ($\\alpha\\approx 0.9$) and, thus, reflect most of the solar irradiance, while oceans have much lower values ($\\alpha\\approx0.05$), absorbing a large amount of solar irradiance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaves, due to their photosynthetic activity, absorb a large proportion of light due to the presence of chlorophylls, as well as other leaf pigments. For that reason, leaves yield relative low albedo values ($\\approx0.15$). On the other hand, soils can have a large range of albedo values, depending on its mineral composition, texture and topsoil moisture. Therefore, the albedo of a vegetated surface will depend not only on leaf chorophyll concentration but also on canopy density and, in a lesser degree, on the soil albedo in situation of sparse vegetation or initial growth stages.\n",

    "## Vegetation anisotropy\n",
    "Most of the Earth surface show certain anisotropic behaviour when reflecting radiation i.e. they scatter more or less radiation depending on scattering direction. The most extreme cases would be specular surfaces (such as mirrors or still water bodies or ice), which scatter most the irradiance in the opposite direction of the incidence angle. The opposite case would be lambertian surfaces, where apparent brighness/scattering is the same regardless the direction.\n",

Therefore, plants will reflect radiation differently depending on the illumination geometry (i.e. the solar  position) and the scattering direction (i.e. the sensor position), possibly changing its albedo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visualize this effect in the following plot. It depicts two polar graphs, one for the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700$\\mu$m) and a second one for the shortwave radiation (SW, 400-2500$\\mu$m). These plots represent the reflectance factors simulated for a homogeneous canopy, using the radiative transfer models PROSPECT-D and 4SAIL.\n",

The radii of the plots show the azimuth angles (0º bearing North, 90º bearing East, 180º bearing South, and 270º bearing West). The solar position is depicted in the graph with a star. By default the sun is placed at solar noon in Northern latitudes (180º azimuth), at a solar zenith angle of 37º. The plots also print the integrated value of the reflectance factors , which is actually the albedo.\n",
